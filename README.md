We are seeing a massive rise in Athlete’s understanding of how recovery plays an impact in areas such as performance, mood regulation and general wellbeing. Applications such as Whoop, Output Sports and Apex Athlete Series have done phenomenally well in the last number of years in areas such as sleep monitoring, load measuring and performance-based metrics. However, the true use of these sites is often stuck behind a massive paywall and require expensive equipment. 

Although most people that are involved in sports performance often view their recovery as “Am I sore?”, this is only one of the key metrics that have been proven to factor into the recovery equation. Hydration, Sleep, Nutrition, etc. play a huge role in determining an Athlete’s readiness and often willingness to train and are often overlooked by the non-elite.

In response to this, I wanted to create a site that allows the user to figure out “How recovered am I today?” through a form submission with multiple questions, allowing them to visually see their recovery score. They can therefore login every day, fill in this form and plan their training accordingly based on how recovered they are.

The aim of this site is to allow the user of the site to calculate their recovery score. Users will experience:
*	a welcome/about page where the user can create an account/login and view the metrics that the site determines for their score
*	Full CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) functionality
*	a delete account feature
*	password reset feature
*	View external sources of information of the attributes measured
*	Submission of a form which will calculate the user recovery score based on answers to their questions
*	A managing of their profile, which will include their score for the today, as well as an “edit/delete” entry if any mistake on their entry was made 
*	A log out section
*	View the entries of everyone that has an account, including a search bar that users can see all the scores of an entered username
*	A green/yellow/red recovery colouring scheme that allows high-impact colouring across the site

The site is designed to be responsive and accessible across all device sizes, as defined in the testing section of this ReadMe file.
The site is also designed to handle the full suite of user management, as defined in the Information architecture of this ReadMe file.
